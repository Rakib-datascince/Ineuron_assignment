What is the relationship between def statements and lambda expressions ?\\nAns: def statement is used to create a normal function. where as lamba expressions are used to create Anonymous functions. which can be assigned to a variable and can be called using \\n      the variable later in function.\\n\\nLambda's body is a single expression and not a block of statements like def statement. The lambda expression's body is similar to what we'd put in a def body's return statement. \\nWe simply type the result as an expression instead of explicitly returning it. Because it is limited to an expression, a lambda is less general than a def statement.\\n\\n2. What is the benefit of lambda?\\nAns: The following are some of the benefits of lambda expressions:\\n\\nCan be used to create Nameless/Anonymous functions inside some complex functions if we are planning to use it only once.\\nModerate to small functions can be created in a single line\\nFuctions created using lambda expressions can be assigned to a variable and can be used by simply calling the variable\\n3.
