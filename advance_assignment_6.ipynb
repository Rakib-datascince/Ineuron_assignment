        "Ans: Exception Processing is important to find exceptions that causes the runtime error. As runtime errors Halt the program execution when exception occurs.\n",

        "Q2. What happens if you don't do something extra to treat an exception?\n",
        "Ans: If Exceptions are not handled flow of program will be broken during the run time which might lead to a abnormal termination of the program. Inshort inability of program to handle exceptions will result in crashing of program.\n",
