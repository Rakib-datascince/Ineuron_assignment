        "Ques no.1 Why are fucntions advantageous to have in your programs?\n",
        "Ans:- Function reduce the need for duplicate code. This makes program shorter ,easier to read,and easier to update . The main advantage of function is code reusability.\n",
        "\n",
        "Ques no. 2 When does the code in a function run: when it's specified or when it's is called ?\n",
        "Ans:- The code in a function exicutes when the function is called , not when the function is specified \n",

        "\n",
        "Ques no. 6 What  happens  to varaible in a local scope when the function call returns?\n",
        "Ans:- When a function returns , the local scope is destroyed , and all the variables in it are forgotten . \n",

        "Ques no. 7 What is the concept of return value ? Is it possible to have a return value in an expression?\n",
        "Ans:- A return value is the value that a function call evaluates to. Like any value, a return value cn be used as\n",
        "      part of an expression .\n",
        "\n",
        "Ques no. 8 If a function does not have a return statement , what is the return value of a call to that function?\n",
        "Ans:- If there is a no return value statement for a function , its return value is None.\n",
        "\n",
        "Ques no. 9 How do you make a function variable refer to the golbal variable?\n",
        "Ans:- A global statement will force a variale in a function to refer to the global varible. If you want to refer\n",
        "      to a global variable in a function, you can use a globale keyword to declare which varibles are global.\n",
